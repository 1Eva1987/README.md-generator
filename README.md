## Description 

When creating an open source project on GitHub, it's important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include the app's purpose, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions. You can quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one.

## Installation

To clone the repository to your local machine use command line: git clone git@github.com:1Eva1987/README.md-generator.git

## Usage

The application will be invoked by using the following command: node index.js. You will be given a number of questions to answer. Once you answer all of the questions the README.md  file will be created in the main folder of the project.
